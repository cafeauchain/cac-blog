<p>Cafe au Chain comes from a desire to connect people more closely with where their coffee is coming from. Starting with small, specialty coffee roasters and farms and co-ops in Latin America, weâ€™re improving the traceability and connection that coffee brings - whether that means providing environmental sustainability information from the farms your coffee comes from, or the economic transparency that specialty roasters strive for in direct trade relationships.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">I love teaching people about where coffee comes from, its history and impact in the world, and what kind of coffee they might enjoy.<br/><span class="right">- Jordan Burke, Founder</span></blockquote>
